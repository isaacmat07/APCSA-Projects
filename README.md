This Java project involves the creation of a Card class to model playing cards, a fundamental component for building card games. The class includes features such as constructors for different card types, accessor and mutator methods, and an getImage() method to extract card images from a sprite sheet. It practices object-oriented programming concepts, static variables, and image manipulation in Java while demonstrating the ability to manage card properties and interactions within a graphical user interface.
