This Java project streamlines "ACME, Inc.'s" payroll process by introducing specialized subclasses of the Employee class, namely Volunteer, Hourly, and Salaried. It practices object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism. The system accurately calculates total payroll and hours worked, and includes a feature to give raises to hourly employees. This application showcases the use of class hierarchies and encapsulation in a real-world application.
